# Multiple Disease Prediction System Using Streamlit

# Introduction
The Multiple Disease Prediction System is a web-based application developed using Streamlit framework that allows users to input values for certain symptoms and the system will predict if the user have Diabetes , Heart Disease or Parkinson's Disease. This system aims to assist users in identifying potential diseases quickly and conveniently, promoting early detection and timely medical intervention.

# Features

* Predicts multiple diseases based on user-provided symptoms.

* User-friendly web interface for symptom input and disease prediction.

* Fast and efficient prediction algorithm.

* Easy to deploy and use.

# Snapshots:

After inputting the values from the dataset we got correct predictions and the snapshots are given below:
